        Note about the diag's. The reason the second value is None is because there is only 1 diag1/diag2.
        In the other cases, the format is "row", (which row), or "col", (which col).
        
        Also, the way Python checks through the if statements means that even if a player wins but uses the last
        space on the board, the code will first register a tie, then later change that in the code to a player win.

Extra Notes:

Need to test find_cell() I can't because I don't have a controller. However, it shouldn't have any errors...
Also need to toggle turn at some point...
