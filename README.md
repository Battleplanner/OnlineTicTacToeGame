# OnlineTicTacToeGame

So this is the repo for the online Tic Tac Toe game. So far, we have Tic Tac Toe Game up and running, and have plans for hosting it
onto a server.

Instructions on how to launch:

As of yet, the three files used to run the game are controllermvc.py, modelmvc.py, and viewmvc.py.
To start, just run the Controller.

Note: Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
